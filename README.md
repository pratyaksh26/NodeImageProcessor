# üñºÔ∏è Node Image Processor - Design Documentation

## üîé Project Overview

The *Node Image Processor* is a modular, C++-based desktop application that enables users to build image processing workflows using a drag-and-drop **node-based interface**. Each node performs a specific function (e.g., blur, sharpen, resize), and nodes can be connected visually to define a processing pipeline. The application is built using **OpenCV**, **ImGui**, and **ImNodes**, offering real-time image preview and a highly interactive editing experience.

## üìä Architecture Overview

### 1. Node System

#### ‚Ä¢ Base Class - Node  
- Declared in `src/nodes/Node.h`  
- Acts as the abstract interface for all image operation nodes.  
- Core methods:
  - `render()`: Displays the node‚Äôs properties in the UI.
  - `process(const std::vector<cv::Mat>& inputs)`: Executes the node's image processing logic.
  - Connection interface methods to manage input/output pins.

#### ‚Ä¢ Specialized Nodes (in `src/nodes/`)  
All processing nodes inherit from the base Node class and define their specific behavior:
- `InputNode`: Loads images from a user-defined path.
- `OutputNode`: Saves the final processed image to disk.
- Image transformation nodes include:
  - `BrightnessNode`
  - `BlurNode`
  - `ContrastNode`
  - `SharpenNode`
  - `GrayscaleNode`
  - `EdgeDetectionNode`
  - `SaturationNode`
  - `ThresholdNode`
  - `ResizeNode`
  - `ColorChannelSplitterNode` (outputs R, G, B channels as separate flows)

#### ‚Ä¢ Graph Execution (in `main.cpp`)
- Manages a list of node instances and connection links.
- Constructs a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** to determine node execution order.
- Executes `process()` for each node in topological order.
- Intermediate outputs are cached in memory and referenced by node ID.

## üß© UI and Interaction

#### ‚Ä¢ ImGui + ImNodes
- **ImGui** renders node property windows and control panels.
- **ImNodes** powers the interactive graph editor.
- Right-click canvas context menu allows adding any node type.
- Links can be created, deleted, and validated interactively.

#### ‚Ä¢ Input & Output Interaction
- **InputNode** uses a text input to specify image file path.
- **OutputNode** allows selecting file format (`.jpg`, `.png`) and provides a Save button.
- Nodes dynamically update previews and outputs based on graph changes.

## ‚öñ Design Decisions

### ‚úî Node-Based Architecture  
- Ensures high modularity and reusability.  
- New features or operations can be added by subclassing the base `Node`.

### ‚úî OpenCV for Processing  
- Efficient and reliable handling of image formats and transformations.  
- Offers a large suite of image processing utilities out-of-the-box.

### ‚úî ImGui & ImNodes for GUI  
- Immediate-mode GUI supports live updates and responsiveness.  
- Node interaction feels intuitive and lightweight.

### ‚úî Simple Build System with CMake  
- Manages third-party libraries and source files.  
- Easily portable to other Linux environments.

## üìë Code Documentation Guidelines

- Code is documented with **inline comments** where logic is non-obvious.
- Every node clearly separates:
  - `render()` ‚Äì UI drawing logic
  - `process()` ‚Äì image computation
- Descriptive names used for classes, functions, and variables for clarity.
